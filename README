IkiWiki-Plugin-purge

IkiWiki plugin to purge changed pages from a front end http accelerator.

This plugin sends a request via HTTP to a front end http accelerator
(like varnish cache) for each page changed after a commit.

A new or changed page will normally result in several changed web
pages in ikiwiki, and the plugin will send a purge request for each.

The method (default PURGE), the request timeout and the cache URI is
configurable in the moinmoin F<blog.setup> file.
